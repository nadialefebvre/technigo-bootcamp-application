# What is Stack Overflow?
Description of what Stack Overflow is.

## Description
This project is a coding introduction that is part of the Technigo Bootcamp application for spring 2022. It has a webpage including a title, a paragraph explaining the chosen word and three links for further information.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS

## Requirements
* Choose one word from the `glossary.md` file with a number that matches my birthday.

    ✅ My word is Stack Overflow.

* Create a small webpage including an explanation of the word.

    ✅ This webpage corresponds to the `info.html` file.

* Include a title, a paragraph explaining the word in ~100 words and three links.

    ✅ The title is included.

    ✅ I decided to divide my text in some smaller paragraphs for more readability.

    ✅ I added four links on this page.

* Spend about four hours on this assignment and add one or two hours to read the suggested material since I haven't coded before.

    ✅ I decided to dive in without reading, eager to try, and I spent about one hour to have a functioning webpage covering all the content requirements.

    ✅ I took the rest of the time to make the page look nice and to add some other features that you can read about in the next section.

## Stretch Goals
* Use a custom font using [Google fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1001467%20%7C%20Material.IO%20%7C%20Global%20%7C%20en%20%7C%20Hybrid%20%7C%20Text%20%7C%20BKWS&utm_term=%7Bkeyword%7D&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItcCyxeaG2AIVwbYYCh3OtgmsEAAYASAAEgJ6O_D_BwE)

    ✅ I included two Google Fonts: Raleway and Lato.

* Make the page responsive and look different on mobile devices than it does on desktop.

    ✅ I did some research to find how it could be done, I applied some solutions that I found, for example setting the font size with rem. I used the DevTools and Device Toggle Toolbar in Chrome to test the look on different devices and the page could adapt to the screen size in a nice way. 

## Other Features
* I created a mini-website (instead of only a webpage) with three pages: `index.html`, `info.html` and `more.html`.

* I added a background using the linear-gradient function for a neat design. I used the RGB-code of the Stack Overflow's website orange combined with grey.

* I used the same colours for the active and visited links.

* I added a menu within a topnav bar at the top, again with the same colours.

* I added an ordered list on `info.html` and an unordered list on `more.html`.

* I added a favicon so a nerd smiley appear to the left of the title of each page.

* I created a class called **content** for the most part of the `index.html` page and added a link to `info.html` page so the whole block is clickable for the visitor to access faster to further information.

* I added an image on the `index.html` page.

* I used the `more.html` page to list the links added in `info.html` but also other ones that I found fun or interesting.

* I added a wider padding on the right of the text, to take into account the background colours on the right.
